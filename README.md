## Dataset retrieval
- News Article data is described here: <http://sciride.org/news.html>
- The processed articles are available here (~16 GB, download completed in May 2021): [Articles Dataset](https://news-mine.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/processed.tar.gz)

## 1. Implementing Naive Bayes Classifier for Text Classification from Scratch

The classifier is implemented as a Python class object called **TextNaiveBayes**, see the file [textnb.py](./textnb.py).
If you download the file [textnb.py](./textnb.py) in your code, you can 
    from textnb import TextNaiveBayes

The TextNaiveBayes class has the following text processing pipeline:
1. Tokenization of the data (from text to sentences to words), removing punctuation and English stopwords
2. Normalization of the tokenized text via stemming (or lemmatization)
3. Creating a vocabulary of distinct word tokens
4. Counting word tokens in each class (is_covid, not_covid)
5. Fitting the training data
6. Predicting labels on the test data
7. Estimating the performance of the classifier using accuracy score metric

>### Model training results
>- TextNaiveBayes classifier was used to recognize COVID-19 related texts
>- The model was trained on 80% of data (~8.3 million news article description texts)
>- Text Naive Bayes classifier achieved **96%** accuracy on the remaining 20% of data (~0.9 million news article description texts)

Download pre-trained model file [Covid19_Text_Classifier](./Covid19_Text_Classifier)(~10.6 MB) and predict on your list of texts:

	import pickle

	# Load the model from disk
	loaded_model = pickle.load(open('Covid19_Text_Classifier', 'rb'))

	# Predict if text is COVID-19 related
	y_predicted = loaded_model.predict(X_test)
	print(y_predicted)

## 2. Analysis of COVID-19 Related News Article Proportions
In this section the previously trained Naive Bayes classifier is used to predict if the news article is related to COVID-19 topic.

The figure below shows the proportions of all articles published in 2020 compared to BBC News outlet.

![Proportions 2020](./Results/covid19_proportion_2020.png "Proportion of COVID-19 Related Articles")
It can be seen that BBC News has almost the same proportions with ~21% of articles related to COVID-19.

The figure below shows the monthly proportions of articles. Data from December month is not complete.

## 3. Named Entitity Recognition
In this section the most commonly mentioned Named Entities with respect to COVID-19 are extracted using the statistical model from [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) library.
spaCy can recognize various types of named entities in a document, by asking the model for a prediction. 
Because models are statistical and strongly depend on the examples they were trained on, this doesnâ€™t always work perfectly and might need some tuning later, depending on your use case.
In the figure below the most common Named Entities (100 words) are shown.
